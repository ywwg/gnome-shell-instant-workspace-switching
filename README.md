# Gnome-shell Instant Workspace Switching

A gnome-shell extension that eliminates the switch time between workspaces without disabling other animations

## Installation

1. Copy the folder disableworkspaceanim@owilliams.mixxx.org/ to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
   (If the extensions/ folder doesn't exist, create it)

1. Either log out and log back in, or restart gnome-shell by pressing Alt-F2, then type r and hit enter.

1. Open gnome-tweak-tool and enable the extension.  It should take effect immediately.
